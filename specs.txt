LabQuest - A roguelike

Setup
------
-You have purchased a building owned by a former mad scientist
-You notice in the basement a secret door to a laboratory
-The scientist was doing animal breeding and gene recombination experiments
 for what could only be nefarious purposes
-The only evidence in the lab of the animals are some preserved specimens in jars
 and skeletons
-There are also a number of notebooks and journals detailing how the scientist
 carried out the experiments and their results
-Upon further searching you notice that there is yet another secret door that leads
 some dark stairs...

So begins, LabQuest!

Game Features
--------------
-A randomly generated laboratory and storage levels on each play
-A random assortment of starting equipment (tools/weapons, chemicals, enzymes, etc...)
-A random assortment of traps and materials and detection devices
-A random assortment of notebook and journal entries, which provide some useful
 hints for the experiments that will inevitably be carried out by the player
    -The journal entries will essentially provide the information about what is required
     for the endgame (e.g., replicating the scientist's final experiment)
-Experimental equipment (gene sequencer, incubator, centrifuge, microscope, spectrometer, etc...)
-Items that must be identified (by experimental implements or usage)
-Random assortments of creatures for the 'storage' (i.e., dungeon) levels with random
 creature combination characteristics
-Randomly placed traps from the scientist (and previous owners)
-Permadeath
-Recombining the genes of creatures to create new ones
-Using evolutionary algorithms to allow for the breeding of new creatures
-Fast travel between the laboratory and previously visited storage levels

Some Notes
-----------
-In a sense this game will be rogue with the fantasy setting replaced
 by mad science (weapons will be tools, magic will be technology)
-I am no expert on biology/chemistry so while some features might imply a need for
 biology/chemistry knowledge that will all be faked
-Much of the equipment/technology will be more science FICTION than science FACT
-The focus will less on fighting creatures (which will not necessarily be
 hostile), but on getting specimens for further experiments by detecting
 creatures and using traps (Fighting will mainly be a last resort)
-The class system will be broken down based on different ways of creating creatures
 (e.g., recombining genes vs. breeding) and the preferred means of procuring
 experimental materials (e.g., trapping vs. live tissue/blood samples vs. DNA samples)
-If this idea actually comes together successfully I would like to add an 'Outside World'
 where various characters may interact with you and your experiments and creatures might
 help them solve their problems
    -It would also provide a good place for your creatures to be set loose and
     cause mayhem...
    -Maybe the real endgame would involve either evilly releasing your abominations into
     the world or nobly using them to further scientific advancement...
